      I am going to become a proffesional web developer for both backend and
      front end. You know what that means that i am going to become a full stack
      developer and you know what this joke is not funny. You all might know one
      of my website which is-
      <strong><a href="youtube.com">See yourself.</a></strong> And also my
      keyboard sucks very much so i have to do something of it too. So let us
      talk about who i really am so i am nothing at present but i am trying to
      become something by doing something. So i like most of things and i don't
      like nothing most of times.
